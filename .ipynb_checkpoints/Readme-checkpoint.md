This is a set of tools to work with finite field numerical ranges. Current functions include:
- Multiply matrices in Zp[i]
- Divide numbers in Zp[i]
- Determine if two vectors are multiples of each other
- Find inverses of matrices
- Generate matrices with given eigenvectors and eigenvalues
- Generate norm-0 and norm-1 vectors

Future functions to be added:
- Calculating and plotting W1 and W0
